## Changes & Customization
This project implements SVG elements inside a React application and has both static and animated graphics. The changes were:

- **Interactive Polygon Manipulation**
    - Used React state (`useState`) to change the shape and position of the pentagon when a button is clicked.
    - Used a radial gradient for the hexagon element.

- **SVG Animation**
    - Animated a moving blue circle using the `<animate>` tag.
    - The circle shifts horizontally from `cx=50` to `cx=150` constantly.
